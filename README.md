# GUI Calculator

## Overview

The GUI Calculator is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) calculator built using the Tkinter library. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The interface uses images for each button, giving it a visually appealing look.

This project is ideal for anyone looking to develop their skills in Python GUI programming, image handling, and basic calculator logic.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear Functionality:** Allows users to reset the current calculation and start fresh.
- **Error Handling:** Displays an "Error" message for invalid input or calculation errors.
- **Graphical Button Design:** Calculator buttons use custom images for a modern appearance.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, you must have the following libraries installed:

Tkinter: Tkinter is a standard Python library for creating GUIs.
Pillow (PIL): Pillow is used to handle and display images in the GUI.

## Getting Started

To run the calculator on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aleshini/GUI_Calculator.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd GUI_Calculator
```
3. Prepare the image assets:

Make sure the image files are stored in the folder

4. Run the calculator:
```bash
python calculator.py
```

## Usage
- **Launch the calculator application:**

- Upon launching, the GUI will display a calculator interface with numeric and operator buttons, represented by images.
- **Perform basic arithmetic operations:**

- Click on the number buttons (0-9) to input numbers.
- Use the operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform operations.
- Click on the = button to compute the result.
- **Clear the display:**
- 
- Click on the clear (C) button to reset the calculator display.
- **Error Handling:*8

- In case of invalid input or division by zero, the calculator will display Error on the screen.
